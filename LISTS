#Lists are basically the data structures and multiple values can be stored in a list
#for example, lets create list called fruits with 5 elements
fruits = ["Mango", "Papaya", "Kiwi", "Orange", "Banana" ]

#print first element from the list
print(fruits[0]) #answer: Mango

#print last element from the list
print(fruits[-1]) #answer: Banana

#To calculate the length(total values in a list) we can use len function
len(fruits) #answer will be 5
