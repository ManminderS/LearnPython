#Lists are basically the data structures and multiple values can be stored in a list
#for example, lets create list called fruits with 5 elements
fruits = ["Mango", "Papaya", "Kiwi", "Orange", "Banana" ]

#In Python, lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. The offset is essentially the index you use to reference elements in the list.
#An offset is commonly used to access or manipulate data at a certain distance from the beginning (or any reference point) of the structure. 
#For example, an offset of 5 means accessing or operating on the element 5 positions away from the starting point.

#print first element from the list
print(fruits[0]) #answer: Mango

#print second element from the list
print(fruits[1]) #answer: Papaya

#print last element from the list
print(fruits[-1]) #answer: Banana

#print second last element from the list and so on
print(fruits[-2]) #answer: Orange

#To calculate the length(total values in a list) we can use len function
len(fruits) #answer will be 5

#Previous line of code gives you the length of the list, but if you do
print(fruits[5]) #this will result into error as
