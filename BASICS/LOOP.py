#Loop is a way of repeating an action until a given condition is met
#for example lets create a list of fruits and using for loop, to print each element of the list.

#create a list called fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Grapes", "Mango"]

#adding loop to print each element of the list "fruits", unless every element is printed
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)   

#RESULT: 
#Apple
#Banana
#Grapes
#Mango
