#this program is WIP and I will be attempted when I learn validation basics.

#Write a program that:
#1. Takes a number N as input.
#2. Prints all the prime numbers between 1 and N.

#take input from the user
user_input = int(input("Enter a positive number"))

# #VALIDATE THE INPUT(WIP as I havent learned while and other concepts that can help me with this one yet, 
#will tackle this once the main part of the program is done)
# #1. Validate for null value
#     if not user_input.strip():
#         print("No Input Found, Please enter the number")
#     elif user_input < 0:
#         print("Error, Number should be posiitve")



#calculate the prime number between 1 and the number given by the user.
#prime numbers are the numbers divisble by 1 and divisible by the number itself.
for num in range(2,user_input):
    if num % 1 == 0 & num 
    
        
    

#Display the result
